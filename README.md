# 🛠️ 8085 Assembler in C++

## 🚀 Overview
This project is a **8085 Assembler** written in **C++**. It takes assembly-level code as input and converts it into machine-level **hexadecimal (hex) code** using a symbol table for effective management of variables and labels.

## 📜 Features
- 📝 **Assembly to Machine Code**: Converts assembly instructions into corresponding machine code in hex.
- 🧠 **Symbol Table Management**: Handles labels, variables, and memory addresses efficiently.
- 🚀 **Fast and Reliable**: Designed to work efficiently with small and large assembly programs.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. 🖊️ **Input**: Provide an assembly program with instructions for the 8085 microprocessor.
2. 🔍 **Processing**: The assembler translates the assembly instructions into machine code using the symbol table.
3. 💻 **Output**: The result is a hexadecimal code that can be used for 8085 microprocessor simulations or hardware programming.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- 🖥️ **C++ Compiler**: Ensure you have `g++` or another C++ compiler installed.
- 🔧 **Basic Understanding of 8085**: Knowledge of 8085 instruction set and assembly language.
